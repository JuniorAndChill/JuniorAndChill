## Featured Projects

### Vulnerability Scanning & Reporting Tool (Computer Systems Security - Spring 2025)

* **Repository:** [L1PsterGram/S25_CSS_05_DC_CR](https://github.com/L1PsterGram/S25_CSS_05_DC_CR) * **Description:** A group project focused on cybersecurity principles. Developed a containerized application using Docker, featuring a Terminal User Interface (TUI) built with Python (`prompt_toolkit`). The TUI serves as a front-end for accessing informational functions and provides an integrated Bash shell environment containing various pentesting tools (Nmap, SQLMap, Nikto, etc.) for manual exploration. Explored concepts of vulnerability scanning and reporting.
* **Key Technologies:** Python, `prompt_toolkit`, Bash, Docker, Git, GitHub Actions (if used), Agile (via GitHub Projects).
* **My Role:** TUI development, Docker setup, Bash scripting, manual tool testing, documentation.
